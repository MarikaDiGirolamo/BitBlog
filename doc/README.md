You can install BitBlog on Linux, macOS, and Windows by following these steps.

---

Linux and MacOS
---

## 1. Install Homebrew

* Homebrew is a package manager for Mac and helps to easily install and uninstall softwares on a Mac.

* To install Homebrew run the following command in the terminal.

```bash
/usr/bin/ruby -e "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install)"

```

    For more detail on Homebrew check [here](https://brew.sh/).

## 2. Install Node

* To install Node on your Mac using Homebrew type the following command.

```bash
    brew install node
```

* Once you have Node installed you can check its version by typing the following command in the terminal.

```bash
    node -v
```

* And, to check the version of NPM type the following command in the terminal.

```bash
    npm -v
```

* Click [here](https://dyclassroom.com/howto-mac/how-to-install-nodejs-and-npm-on-mac-using-homebrew) to read the tutorial on How to install NodeJS on Mac.

## 3. Install TypeScript

* We will install TypeScript globally on our Mac so that we can access it from any directory. For this we will use the following command.

```bash
   sudo npm install -g typescript
```

* Once you have TypeScript installed use the following command to check the version.

```bash
   tsc -v
```

* To convert app.ts file into app.js file we use the following command in the terminal.

```bash
  tsc app.ts
```

* To uninstall TypeScript globally we use the following command.

```bash
 sudo npm uninstall -g typescript
```

---

Windows
---

## 1. Install Node.js

* Unless you need to install a different version (like for example if you're doing a tutorial and the tutor tells you to install a specific version), I would advise to install the latest. You can find it [here](https://nodejs.org/en/).

* Check if node has been installed successfully.

```bash
 node -v
```

* Use the LTS (long time support) variant
If everything is ok, you should see something like [v12.16.1]

## 2. Install Typescript

```bash
 npm install -g typescript
```

* Check for Typescript being installed

```bash
 tsc -v 
```

## 3. Install dependencies

```bash
    npm install

```
